## Applications

### Pre-Learning
* **No more Garbage In Garbage Out**: Quantify the value of using your datasets to solve your regression or classification problem prior to feeding it to a model, and only feed datasets that are expected to add value to your regression or classification model.


### Post-Learning
* **No more flying blind, No more model trial and error**: Rigorously determine whether your trained regression or classification model can be improved without resorting to additional datasets/inputs. Quantify how much more juice can still be extracted from existing existing datasets, relative to your trained model. 
* **Datasets valuation**: Select the datasets that best complements your existing datasets for solving your regression or classification problem.
