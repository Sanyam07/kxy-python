Memoryless Observations
***********************
In this section we provide the intuition for, and the theoretical underpinnings of our solutions to the **pre-learning** and **post-learning** problems in data science life cycles, when observations do not exhibit temporal structures to be exploited. For our treatment of time series, see the :ref:`Time Series` section.
